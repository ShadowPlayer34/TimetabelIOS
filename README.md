# TimetableApp for IOS
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>this app is for students who need a good and beautiful timetable app. It was created for the reason that my university didn’t make an application and it’s very inconvenient to track the schedule, so I decided to combine my Swift learning with the useful one and create this application</p>
