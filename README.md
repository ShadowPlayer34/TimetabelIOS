# TimetableApp for IOS
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This app is for students who need a good and beautiful timetable app. It was created for the reason that my university didn’t make an application and it’s very inconvenient to track the schedule, so I decided to combine my Swift learning with the useful one and create this application</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, a full installation is not possible now, because this application is not posted in the AppStore. But if you really want to try it, then you should:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Download this repository to your Mac, it won’t work with Windows</li>
  <li>Install Xcode, using the AppStore</li>
  <li>Open the downloaded repository in Xcode</li>
  <li>Connect your IOS device to Mac and select it in the list of simulators</li>
  <li>Run the project</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This application will appear on your phone, but after about 7 days it will be blocked and you will have to reconnect the phone and run the project again</p>
